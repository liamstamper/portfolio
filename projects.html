            (No demo is yet provided because Seatstock is on going project)<br> Seatstock is an online platform intended
            to permanently simplify the exchange of student tickets to any and all university sporting events. Starting with 
            the University of Iowa we are proving a way for students to securely sell any student section ticket they don't plan
            to use. Not only am I a founder of this project I served as Lead Front End enginner for the site. For frontend design I 
            predominantly worked using React and Tailwind.

        <div class="projects-about">Lastly I think this site is worth including on my project list. I have made its repo public on github in hopes of showing how I made it
            and proving a glipse into my skills in HTML/CSS.
