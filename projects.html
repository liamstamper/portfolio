                (No demo is yet provided because Seatstock is on going project)<br> Seatstock is an online platform meant
                to permanently simplify the exchange of student tickets to any and all university sporting events. Starting with 
                the University of Iowa (the next step will be expanding to other universities) we are providing a way for students to securely
                sell any student section ticket they don't plan
                to use. Not only am I a founder of this project I served as lead frontend engineer for the site. For frontend design I 
                predominantly worked using React and Tailwind CSS. As soon as this project launches (expected date is November 30th) I will upload
                a video walkthrough and link the site.

                and proving a glipse into my skills in HTML/CSS.
