                    This year I helped found a startup called SeatStock and worked as lead Front End Developer. During this time I was pushed out of my comfort zone and introduces to many new frameworks including React Native and Tailwind CSS. Working with other developers and designers I really took the opportunity to make progress on my webdevelopment skills and design. You can read more about this project and take a peek at what it looks like <b>here.</b>

                    <year>2022</year>
                    In 2022 I interned with Quality Manufacturing Corporation as a Full Stack Developer. This was an extremely valuable experience. I worked on a team with very experienced developers so as I was introduced to new frameworks and worked through my assignments I had great support. This gave me my first picture of what development work is like and where I needed to direct my focus inorder to become a better developer.

                Between my own solo projects and working on <b>Seatstock</b> I have become really interested in webdevelopment and all its possibilites. Looking forward I hope to gain more high level experience in industy and collaborate on more large scale projects.

                I am always looking to connect CS with some of my other hobbies and use my knowledge. One hobby I spend a lot of my time on is Rock Climbing. With connecting the two in mind I have been exploring different softwares to model plans for constructing a home wall.
